== Introduction ==

Welcome to, and thankyou for downloading, FUPPES (Free UPnP Entertainment Service)!

FUPPES is a free, multiplatform UPnP A/V Media Server. FUPPES supports a wide 
range of UPnP MediaRenderers as well as on-the-fly transcoding of various audio, 
video and image formats. FUPPES also includesbasic DLNA support.


== Basic Installation ==

FUPPES uses standard GNU automake and as such all it requires to install is a:

  autoreconf -vfi   # step 1
  ./configure       # step 2
  make              # step 3
  make install      # step 4

It should be noted that before step 2 you may like to try './configure --help' to see
what your options are and then run './configure' with the options that you want.
And on Debian based systems you will likely need to prefix the 'sudo' command 
to the 'make install' so that it will run with the right privileges.


== Security Notice ==

The only times that fuppes will require 'root' priveliges are:

  1) When you are dealing with the init.d script.
  2) When you are installing a packaged version of fuppes.
  3) When you are running make install.

For security reasons fuppes should not be run as root at any other time.
